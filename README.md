# SpecFlow to Reqnroll Migration Guide

If you’ve been using SpecFlow for your test automation, you might have heard that it no longer supports .NET 8 or 9 or above.

Don’t worry! There’s a new tool called Reqnroll that you can switch to within a few minutes or hours for a test project or application, and it works a lot like SpecFlow.

This guide will help you move your tests from SpecFlow to Reqnroll, ensuring a smooth and seamless transition.

## Overview

SpecFlow was created by Gáspár Nagy, one of the founders of TechTalk and a significant figure in the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) community. BDD is a way of writing tests that everyone can understand, and Reqnroll is based on the same principles. This means that most of what you’ve done with SpecFlow will still work with Reqnroll.

This guide is based on the [official Reqnroll migration guide](https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/guides/migrating-from-specflow.html) and includes practical examples and sample projects to help you with the migration.

## Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2022**
- Install the .NET 7 or .NET 8 SDK on your development machine.
- A basic understanding of SpecFlow.
- Knowledge of API and UI automation testing.

The original project is built using MSTest and covers various aspects of testing, including:

- **UI Testing with Selenium**: Automates browser interactions to test web applications.
- **API Testing with RestSharp**: Tests RESTful APIs to ensure they work correctly and handle various requests and responses.
- **Data Testing with SQL Server (.mdb file)**: Validates data operations and interactions with a SQL Server for testing ETL processes.

Ensure you have the SpecFlow extensions installed in your Visual Studio 2022.

## Feature File Types

The project includes several types of feature files, each representing different scenarios and testing needs. Below are scenarios and test hooks that will be more realistic for our projects:

- **Normal Feature File**: Contains straightforward scenarios for basic test cases.
  
- **Feature File with Examples**: Uses the `Examples` table to test multiple sets of data with the same scenario.

- **Feature File with DataTables**: Incorporates complex data structures within the scenario for testing.

- **Feature File with External Data Source**: Uses external data sources such as Excel or CSV files, specified with annotations like `@DataSource:ExternalDataSQL_UsersData.xlsx @DataSet:Users`.

- **Hooks**: Includes setup and teardown logic to prepare the test environment and clean up after tests.

## Migrating to Reqnroll: A Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Reqnroll Visual Studio Extensions**

   Start by installing the Reqnroll Visual Studio extensions to enable support for Reqnroll in your IDE.

2. **Disable SpecFlow Extensions**

   Before proceeding, ensure that any existing SpecFlow extensions are disabled to avoid conflicts.

3. **Update Project Properties to .NET 8**

   Update your project’s properties to target .NET 8, ensuring compatibility with Reqnroll.

4. **Update Microsoft NuGet Packages to Version 8**

   Update all relevant Microsoft NuGet packages in your project to version 8 to align with the .NET 8 framework.

5. **Install Reqnroll NuGet Packages**

   Install the necessary Reqnroll NuGet packages for your project, replacing SpecFlow dependencies with Reqnroll equivalents.

6. **Rebuild the Project**

   Rebuild your project. You’ll notice that the `feature.cs` files have been regenerated, replacing SpecFlow references with Reqnroll.

7. **Resolve Build Errors**

   If you encounter build errors, start by removing any `using` statements related to SpecFlow. Replace them with the appropriate Reqnroll namespaces.

8. **Replace TableRow with DataTableRow**

   In your code, replace instances of `TableRow` with `DataTableRow`. This is necessary for Reqnroll compatibility.

9. **Test Results After Migration**

   After making these changes, run your tests to ensure everything is working as expected. Verify that the migration has not introduced any issues.

10. **Project Renaming and Solution Setup**

    To make the migration process clearer, the project has been renamed to "BDDTesting.Net8" to reflect the updated framework version. Additionally, both .NET 7 (SpecFlow) and .NET 8 (Reqnroll) projects are included in the same solution. This setup allows for easy reference and comparison, helping you to understand the differences and improvements that come with the migration.

## Additional Notes

- Duplicate rows in examples will not be supported and may throw unexpected exceptions. Remove any duplicate entries to avoid this issue.
- If you encounter any issues, please post them in the comments section along with the solutions.
- For more information, please refer to the official [Reqnroll migration guide](https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/guides/migrating-from-specflow.html).
