# SpecFlow to Reqnroll Migration Guide

If you're currently using SpecFlow for test automation, you might have noticed that it no longer supports .NET 8 or newer versions. But don't worry! You can quickly switch to **Reqnroll**, a tool that closely resembles SpecFlow, within just a few minutes or hours.

This guide will assist you in migrating your tests from SpecFlow to Reqnroll, ensuring a smooth and seamless transition.

## Overview

SpecFlow, developed by Gáspár Nagy, a prominent figure in the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) community, is built on principles that Reqnroll also follows. This means that most of your SpecFlow work will be transferable to Reqnroll.

This guide is based on the official Reqnroll migration guide and includes practical examples and sample projects to facilitate the migration process.

## Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2022**
- **.NET 7 and .NET 8 SDK**: Ensure it is installed on your development machine.
- **Basic Understanding of SpecFlow**
- **Knowledge of API and UI Automation Testing**

The original project is built using MSTest and covers:

- **UI Testing with Selenium**: Automates browser interactions for web application testing.
- **API Testing with RestSharp**: Ensures RESTful APIs function correctly.
- **Data Testing with SQL Server (.mdb file)**: Validates data operations and ETL processes.

Make sure you have the SpecFlow extensions installed in Visual Studio 2022.

## Feature File Types

The project includes several types of feature files to cover various scenarios:

- **Normal Feature File**: For straightforward test cases.
- **Feature File with Examples**: Tests multiple data sets with the same scenario using the Examples table.
- **Feature File with DataTables**: Incorporates complex data structures within scenarios.
- **Feature File with External Data Source**: Utilizes external sources like Excel or CSV files with annotations such as `@DataSource:ExternalDataSQL_UsersData.xlsx @DataSet:Users`.
- **Hooks**: For setup and teardown logic to prepare the test environment and clean up afterward.

## Migrating to Reqnroll: A Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Reqnroll Visual Studio Extensions**

   Begin by installing the Reqnroll Visual Studio extensions to enable Reqnroll support in your IDE.

2. **Disable SpecFlow Extensions**

   Ensure that any existing SpecFlow extensions are disabled to avoid conflicts.

3. **Update Project Properties to .NET 8**

   Change your project’s target framework to .NET 8 for compatibility with Reqnroll.

4. **Update Microsoft NuGet Packages to Version 8**

   Upgrade all relevant Microsoft NuGet packages to version 8 to align with .NET 8.

5. **Install Reqnroll NuGet Packages**

   Install the necessary Reqnroll NuGet packages, replacing SpecFlow dependencies with their Reqnroll counterparts.

6. **Rebuild the Project**

   Rebuild your project. The `feature.cs` files will be regenerated, substituting SpecFlow references with Reqnroll.

7. **Resolve Build Errors**

   If you encounter build errors, remove any `using` statements related to SpecFlow and replace them with the appropriate Reqnroll namespaces.

8. **Replace `TableRow` with `DataTableRow`**

   Replace instances of `TableRow` with `DataTableRow` in your code for Reqnroll compatibility.

9. **Test Results After Migration**

   Run your tests to ensure that everything functions as expected and that the migration did not introduce any issues.

## Project Renaming and Solution Setup

The project has been renamed to **"BDDTesting.Net8"** to reflect the updated framework version. Both .NET 7 (SpecFlow) and .NET 8 (Reqnroll) projects are included in the same solution for easy reference and comparison, helping you understand the differences and benefits of the migration.

## Additional Notes

- Duplicate rows in examples are not supported and may cause unexpected exceptions. Remove any duplicates to avoid this issue.
- If you encounter issues, please post them in the comments section along with any solutions.
